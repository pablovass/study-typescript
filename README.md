### About TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It enables developers to write more robust and maintainable code by catching errors during development rather than at runtime. TypeScript code is eventually compiled to JavaScript, allowing it to run on any JavaScript runtime.
